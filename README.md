SUGGESTION:
When we are trying to approach a problem, we should always start from brute force solution, even though you have been trained by solving a lot of similar problems previously and been able to give a O(N) solution off the top of your head, I still recommend you to start from a brute force solution. This is the only way you can avoid geting stuck in your fixed mindset when you encounter a completely unseen or unfamiliar problem that unfortunately doesn't match any existing pattern in your trained mind.
